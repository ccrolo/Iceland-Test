# Travel to Iceland Test - Run the application

This project does not have any specific configuration to be able to run, as it is developed with CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## Some recommendations:

- After downloading you can open the index.js file directly in the browser, by double clicking on the file or dragging it to the browser search bar. It will open on a localhost port.

- In Visual Studio Code you can use the Live Server extension to run the project. Once this application is installed, right click on the index.html file and you will be able to access the "open with Live Server" option.

- Once opened in the browser, It is recommended using an application such as Responsively to correctly view the different formats on different devices.

- The project is configured to be as similar as possible to the reference designs, based on the dimensions provided. But it also works in different formats.
